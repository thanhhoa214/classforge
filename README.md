ClassForge Algorithm Pipeline - README
======================================

Overview
--------
This pipeline implements an AI-powered classroom allocation algorithm based on social network analysis (SNA), multi-link prediction, and constraint programming. The entire process begins with the dataset `test_data_1.xlsx` (will use databased later) and produces three main outputs:

- `df`: Enriched student features (survey predictions + SNA metrics)
- `Y_pred_df`: Predicted survey outcomes with new classroom allocations
- `predicted_links`: Social tie predictions after thresholding

These outputs are generated by the function `load_agent_data()` in `execution.py`.

**Libraries Requirements**
--------------------------
The libraries that need to be installed: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, torch, torch_geometric, ortools
Code to execute:
pip install pandas
pip install numpy
pip install scikit-learn
pip install matplotlib
pip install torch-scatter torch-sparse torch-geometric
pip install ortools

Pipeline Steps
--------------
1. Load survey and network data from Excel file
2. Compute well-being scores and social metrics
3. Train node embeddings (RGCN)
4. Predict social links between students
5. Predict survey scores for each student
6. Allocate students into classrooms using CP-SAT solver
7. Return outputs for AI assistant or evaluation

File Descriptions
-----------------

1. feature_engineer.py
   - Loads and preprocesses data
   - Computes academic, social, and mental well-being
   - Merges survey data with SNA metrics

2. node_embeddings.py
   - Uses RGCN to produce 32-dimensional node embeddings
   - Visualises embeddings using t-SNE for class separation

3. multilink_prediction.py
   - Predicts social links (multi-label)
   - Applies intra/inter-class thresholds to generate connections

4. cp_sat.py
   - Allocates students into balanced classes using CP-SAT solver
   - Constraints: equal class sizes, one class per student, optimise ties (minimise bully)

5. execution.py
   - Main file to run the full pipeline
   - Loads data, calls all other modules, and returns final outputs

Input
-----
- Excel file: `test_data_1.xlsx` (will use Database later)

Output
------
- `df`: Final enriched features with well-being scores
- `Y_pred_df`: Survey predictions + new class allocation
- `predicted_links`: Finalised social tie predictions
